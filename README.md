# About LetMeBuild

### What's LetMeBuild doing ?
LetMeBuild is a plugin allowing members of a WorldGuard region to fly inside of it.
We're also looking for more compatibility, contact me on Discord if you want to see a plugin added inside of our **supported plugins** list.

Thank you for using our plugin and go check our [GitHub](https://github.com/AdventumMC) for more plugins made by Adventum's team !
